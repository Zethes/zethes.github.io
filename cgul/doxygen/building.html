<div class="textblock"><p>Jatta is still in development so the contents of this page are expected to change. </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="requirements"></a>
Requirements</h1>
<p>In order to build Jatta you will need <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a> and the libraries that Jatta depends on. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="cmake"></a>
CMake</h2>
<p>The minimum version of CMake required is CMake 2.8.7. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="libraries"></a>
Libraries</h2>
<p>A link to each library necessary is on the <a class="el" href="acknowledgements.html">Acknowledgements</a> page. Note, however, that you can build Jatta without any of these libraries and you will simply lack the functionality that they provide. In the future we will provide pre-built binaries but for now you are on your own. </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="get_source"></a>
Getting the Source</h1>
<p>The latest source code is available over at our Github page.<br/>
 There are no official releases of Jatta at this time.<br/>
 <a href="http://www.github.com/Zethes/Jatta">http://www.github.com/Zethes/Jatta</a> </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="compatibility"></a>
Compatibility</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="windows"></a>
Windows</h2>
<p>Jatta has been tested with Windows 7 but should work with Vista. No testing has been done on XP. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="macos"></a>
Mac OS</h2>
<p>Jatta has been tested with Mac OS 10.6 and should work with anything newer. Jatta may work with Mac OS 10.5 but it has not been tested. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="linux"></a>
Linux</h2>
<p>Jatta is primarily tested on Ubuntu and Arch Linux but should work with any distro. Jatta requires X11 for window systems and ALSA for audio, but those can optionally be excluded from the build. </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="generators"></a>
CMake Generators</h1>
<p>CMake offers a wide variety of build system generators and there is a continued effort to support all of them. Some of them may be indirectly supported, but the following generators are regularly tested and are recommended:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unix Makefiles</li>
<li>MinGW Makefiles</li>
<li>MSYS Makefiles</li>
<li>Visual Studio 10*</li>
<li>Xcode</li>
</ul>
<p><em>* no other versions of Visual Studio have been tested but may work</em> </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="compiler"></a>
Compiler Requirements</h1>
<p>Jatta will attempt to exclude any features not supported by a compiler so older compilers are still supported. Tests have included GCC versions as old as 4.4. Many C++11 features have found their way into the code base and to take full advantage of them we recommend using a newer GCC or Clang compiler. If you are on Windows we recommend both MinGW and Visual Studio compilers. </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="generating"></a>
Generating</h1>
<p>Now that the requirements are out of the way, and CMake is installed on your machine, we can begin building the library. The first step is to generate a build system with CMake (from the list of generators above, or another unsupported generator). Open up a terminal and charge directory to the Jatta source directory and make a directory called build, then run the CMake command:<br/>
 </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">cd /dir/to/Jatta/</div>
<div class="line">mkdir build</div>
<div class="line">cd build</div>
<div class="line">cmake -G <span class="stringliteral">&quot;GENERATOR&quot;</span> ..</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p> Replace <em>GENERATOR</em> with the preferred generator. This may take some time depending on the generator but once it completes you will be able to build Jatta with the preferred build system. For instance if you used a makefile, you can simply type "make" to start the build. </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="customize"></a>
Customizing the Build</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="cmake_cache"></a>
CMake Cache Editors</h2>
<p>The build process for Jatta is designed to be easily customized and troubleshooted. We recommend using either cmake-gui or ccmake to customize the build. Depending on your installation of cmake you may have received both, only one, or neither of these tools. If you do not have cmake-gui or ccmake you will need to research how to obtain either of them on your system. cmake-gui is a gui version while ccmake uses ncurses and runs through a terminal. To check if you have either of these type "cmake-gui" or "ccmake" in a terminal followed by the directory of the build. </p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">cd /dir/to/Jatta/build</div>
<div class="line">ccmake .</div>
<div class="line">cmake-gui .</div>
</div><!-- fragment --> <h1><a class="anchor" id="installing"></a>
Installing Jatta</h1>
<p>It is recommended that you install Jatta in the default location already defined in the CMake code. <b>If Jatta is not installed in the correct place then CMake will not know where to find it.</b> If you do not wish to use CMake for your application then it does not matter where Jatta is installed so long as you link against the propery libraries and includes.<br/>
 If you do not wish to install you can create a package instead. Each generator has its own method for installing and packaging. For makefiles you can type "make install" to install or "make
package" to create a package using CPack. Look up CPack for more information on the packages that can be created. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="modifying_cache"></a>
Modifying Cache</h2>
<p>If you have used CMake before then you probably know how this works already. A CMake build process uses a variety of variables that can be adjusted to change how the application is built. The goal with Jatta is to create a cache variable out of everyone important aspect of the build so that they can be modified as desired. If you have opened ccmake or cmake-gui you will see this list yourself. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the software if you haven't done so already.<br/>
 The remainder of this page will be dedicated to documenting every CMake variable defined in the Jatta build process, so lets start with a simple example to get started. Locate the variable "Jatta_STATIC" and, if it is OFF, flip it to ON. Now configure and generate the build (with "c" and "g" in ccmake or using the buttons in the gui). Once the build has generated, rebuild the library. The result should be a static library instead of the shared library that Jatta is usually built as. In addition, the CMake scripts generated to import Jatta are modified to better suite a static library, and, ideally, Jatta can be imported smoothly into another CMake project. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="cache_variables"></a>
Cache Variables</h2>
<table  cellspacing="0" cellmargin="0">
<tr>
<td>Name</td><td style="width:100%">Description  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Jatta_STATIC</td><td style="width:100%">Generates a static library instead of a shared library. A static library does not have any concept of linkage so the libraries required to build Jatta must be linked against in the final application as well. For this reason, the CMake scripts generated capable of finding Jatta and using it in another CMake application will contain special logic to find and link against those libraries as well.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Jatta_DEPENDENCY_INCLUDE_DIRS</td><td style="width:100%">By default this cache variable will be differently on each operating system to point to a dependencies directory in the Jatta source folder. The folder will be named "deps-SYSTEM" where SYSTEM is the current system name. The system name will be windows, mingw, linux or darwin (mac). After the dependency directory there will be a /include to specify the include directory for this system's include files. The main purpose of this cache variable is to allow the Jatta build process to look in a specified directory for dependencies, which different from one operating system to the next.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Jatta_DEPENDENCY_LIBRARY_DIRS</td><td style="width:100%">See Jatta_DEPENDENCY_INCLUDE_DIRS. This cache variable serves the same purpose as the include directory, except it specifies a library directory for the libraries. On a 32bit system the library directory will simply be "lib" and on non-32bit systems it will be "libX" where X is the bitness of the system (for example, "lib64").  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Jatta_LIBRARY_INCLUDE_DIRS</td><td style="width:100%">Specifies additional include directories for Jatta. This cache variable may be set by default in an attempt to find libraries in non-standard locations (for instance freetype2 is often in a non standard location).  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Jatta_OUTPUT_NAME</td><td style="width:100%">Changes several output files to use the name specified instead of simply "Jatta." There are a variety of reasons why you may want the library to be labelled differently since the library is so customizable. It is useful, for instance, to rename the output name to "JattaD" for a debug version of the library. Changing this variable does not change the code at all (for instance everything is still namespaced with "Jatta") however it does change the CMake scripts used to locate Jatta and the installation path, both of which will use this name instead.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Jatta_USE_NETWORK</td><td style="width:100%">Change to OFF to exclude network functionality from the build. The network code uses system libraries which should always be present on the system.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Jatta_USE_OPENGL</td><td style="width:100%">Change to OFF to exclude OpenGL functionality from the build. This defaults to OFF if glew was not found.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Jatta_FIX_INSTALL_PATH <em>(advanced)</em></td><td style="width:100%">(Only works on first generation) Fixes up the installation path of Jatta on first generation. This variable can be specified at first generation with "cmake -DJatta_FIX_INSTALL_PATH=OFF" to use default CMake installation directories. Not recommended.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Jatta_INLINE_DEFINE <em>(advanced)</em></td><td style="width:100%">The C++ keyword to use for inline functions and methods defined in a header file. This is usually blank since inline keywords are not required in declarations.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Jatta_INSTALL_ESSENTIALS_ONLY <em>(advanced)</em></td><td style="width:100%">Only installs or packages files essential to using Jatta. Excludes any documentation or CMake files. When this is specified Jatta is installed in /usr/ instead of /usr/lib/Jatta-VERSION on unix systems. This installation change causes libraries to install in /usr/lib (or /usr/lib64) and headers to install in /usr/include.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Jatta_PRETEND_BITNESS <em>(advanced)</em></td><td style="width:100%">The bitness of the system (32 or 64). This can be changed to pretend it is a different bitness.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Jatta_REFRESH_LIBRARIES <em>(advanced)</em></td><td style="width:100%">If changes are made to a library cache variable (see below) then this should be temporary switched to ON to properly refresh them. To speed up generation library settings are cached and will not be checked again unless this is ON.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>DOXYGEN_ENABLE</td><td style="width:100%">Generates Doxygen docs are part of the build process. Off by default.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>DOXYGEN_WARNINGS <em>(advanced)</em></td><td style="width:100%">Set to ON to see Doxygen warnings in the build process or OFF to supress them.  </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The following cache variables relate to libraries required by Jatta. <b>NAME</b> is used to denote a library name. See the cache variables in cmake-gui or ccmake to see all libraries. </p>
<table  cellspacing="0" cellmargin="0">
<tr>
<td>Name</td><td style="width:100%">Description  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>NAME</b>_LIBRARY</td><td style="width:100%">The location of the library to use when building a release. If this is not specified then the build system will use the debug library instead. If neither this variable nor the debug variable are properly set, this library will not be used in the build. Ideally this will be automatically set during first generation.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>NAME</b>_DEBUG_LIBRARY</td><td style="width:100%">See <b>NAME</b>_LIBRARY, this cache variable specifies the debug library location.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>NAME</b>_IGNORE</td><td style="width:100%">Set this to ON if a library was found but is not desired to be included in the build.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>NAME</b>_REQUIRED</td><td style="width:100%">Set this to ON to fail generation if the library was not found.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>NAME</b>_SHARED</td><td style="width:100%">Used internally and automatically detected via file extension. This variable should be ON if the library is a shared library or OFF if it is a static library.  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>NAME</b>_PACKAGE</td><td style="width:100%">Packages the library along with Jatta when it is packaged or installed. This is on by default for static libraries and off by default for shared libraries. Additionally, changing this to ON will cause the CMake scripts generated by Jatta to load in those libraries and link against them when importing Jatta into another CMake project.  </td></tr>
